### What's for Lunch?

Don't know what to eat? Let What's for Lunch help you decide!!
A simple app to help you decide what to eat nearby.

### `Wire Frame`

### Main

This app will randomly generate a place to eat for lunch. The user will input their zipcode and a specific cusine, if they wish, and it will return a place to eat.

### `Technologies`

I will be using axios to fetch the data from the Yelp Api. Along with mapping the list of restaurant to render, as will as randomly picking a restaurant.

## Api used

I will be using the Yelp api to get a list of restaurant data.

## Obstacles

I forsee minor obstacles, however I have to figure out a efficient way to randomly generate a restaurant.

## Solution

I could use Math.random to generate a random number for the index of the array restaurants.

## MVP AND POST MVP

My MVP will be a fully designed and fucntion app to generate a random restaurant once the specified inputs are fulfilled. After clicking submit it will display the restaurant with all the restaurant's information.

My Post MVP will incorporate the slackbot to run the app or link to the app and generate an place to eat along with a timer that will let students know when lunch is over.
